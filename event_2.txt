Event #2:
Some internet celebrity has created a panel discussion on his Youtube channel and he is inviting political party leaders to his show. We have the possibility to attend the session and meet with the spectators. The spectators are usually university students and their questions are usually aggresive in tone, usually attacking the invited leader. This may be excellent for publicity. Although, some questions will need to be evaded or answered with non-answers. This may cause disdain in the short term.
